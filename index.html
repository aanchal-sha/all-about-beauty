            <p>Hi! Thanks for stopping by, My name is Aanchal. Welcome to my blog "All about beauty by A"<br>

                Beauty and writing has always been close to my heart since I was a teenager <br>
                
                So, this website that you see is my first attempt at combining my web development skills and my passion for beauty. <br>
                
                Beauty and writing has always been close to my heart since I was a teenager.

                So via this blog, I am going to educate you guys about the basic skincare products focusing on their reviews as well as some bits about makeup.
