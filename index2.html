            <p>Hi! Thanks for stopping by, My name is Aanchal. Welcome to my blog "All about beauty by A"<br> </p>

            <p>Beauty and writing has always been close to my heart since I was a teenager <br>

                So, this website that you see is my first attempt at combining my web development skills and my passion
                for
                beauty. <br></p>

            <p><em>Beauty and writing has always been close to my heart since I was a teenager.</em>
                So via this blog, I am going to educate you guys about the basic skincare products focusing on their
                reviews
                as well as some bits about makeup.
            </p>
